## Overview

This bot serves multiple purposes including Coin Flips, a Random Number Generator, and a 1v1 Battle system! Its intended use was for CS:GO case openings within my friend group.

## Usage

```
!flip  
```

  Flips a coin and prints out either "HEADS" or "TAILS" in the chat.

```
!number <first> <last>  
```

Generates a random number *first* - *last* inclusively.

```
!battle @<User> <heads/tails>  
```

Challenges another user to a coin flip. The user who initiates the battle chooses either heads or tails. The bot will countdown from 3 and print the outcome of the coin flip along with the winner.
